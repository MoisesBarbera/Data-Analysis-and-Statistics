# LOOKING FOR THE HIGGS BOSON (a statistical analysis)

A study showing how to identify the presence of a Higgs Boson from two data sets produced at ATLAS during 2012.

ATLAS is one of the two experiments at CERN (The Euopean Organization for Nuclear Research), where I worked at during 2019, that discovered the existance of the Higgs Boson in 2012.

This study, shows and explains step by step all the processes needed to prepare the data, how to create models for the data, filter background signals and how to evaluate the viability of the models.
