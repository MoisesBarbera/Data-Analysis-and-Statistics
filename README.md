Following suggested projects from my University, I expanded the scope to better prepare on this topic

# Moises_Barbera_Higgs_Project

Two sets of data from the ATLAS photon-photon Higgs search have been studied and analysed aiming to find the Higgs Boson from this data. * ATLAS_DATA1.mat and ATLAS_DATA2.mat

Some of the presented visualizations cover:

 Background Data: 
 
 – The background data with a ﬁtted exponential distribution 
 
 – The residuals of the previous plot 
 
 – The relevant χ2 distribution for the background model, with my χ2 statistic plotted 
 
 – The normalised χ2 distribution for the background model, with my normalised χ2 statistic plotted
 
 
• Higgs Data: 

– The relevant χ2 distribution for the background model, with the χ2 statistic plotted

– The normalised χ2 distribution for the background model , with my normalised χ2 statistic plotted 

– The Higgs data with both my models (background, background + Higgs) 

– The relevant χ2 distribution for my Higgs model, with your χ2 statistic plotted 

– The residuals (data - expected background) showing the two models (background, background + Higgs)
